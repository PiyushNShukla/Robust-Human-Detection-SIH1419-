# Robust-Human-Detection-SIH1419-
-This project detects human and locks it as a target .Also visual alarm is generated upon anomaly detection (i.e. human jumping/ crawling/ running).
# Created using YOLOv8 model
THe YOLOv8 model is trained on a custom dataset for multi class prediction of different human actions such as :
Walking
Running
Standing
Sitting
Crawling


The model is trained in Goolgle Colabratory

The frontend is developed using HTML,CSS and JavaScript
THe backend integrates the machine model and the frondend using Flask in Python
